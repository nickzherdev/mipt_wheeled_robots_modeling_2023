Homework #3

In this homework assignment, we will implement a PID controller to control the steering wheel of an autonomous vehicle. We will test the implemented regulator on a simulator of an autonomous car,
designed for Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim).

We will use a prepared docker container for homework (of course you can install everything into your local OS or use virtual machine if you prefer to).
In the directory where the archive is unpacked, build the docker image:

docker build . --tag homework3

After building the image, you can start the container with the command:

sudo docker run -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --name hw3 -it homework3

** Warning ** If you get an error, starting graphical applications from the container, run the following command on you host OS:
xhost + local

*** You may also try DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY

To run an additional terminal in a container, you can find out the CONTAINER ID by running the "docker ps" command and finding the required container in the CONTAINER ID output. After that, you need to run the command:

docker exec -it hw3 zsh

** Warning ** With this method of launching an additional terminal, the launch of graphical applications will not be available from it.

In the container, you need to go to the homework/homework3/ directory:

cd homework/homework3/

The homework directory contains three folders:
* cpp - directory containing files to realizae PID regulator in C++;
* cpp - directory containing files to realizae PID regulator in Python;
* term2_sim_linux/ - directory with a simulator of an autonomous vehicle.

To run the simulator, run the file /homework/homework3/term2_sim_linux/term2_sim.x86_64:

/homework/homework3/term2_sim_linux/term2_sim.x86_64

Select the "Project 4: PID Controller" tab and press Select.



There are two programming languages which can be used for this assignment (ะก++ or Python). Depending on the language you prefer proceed to the corresponding section.



======
ะก++
======

In another terminal (not the one you used to launch simulator) of the container, you need to run a car control program with an implemented PID controller.
To do this, go to the source code folder:

cd /homework/homework3/cpp/CarND-PID-Control-Project

Create a build directory and build the project:

mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make

Start the regulator (** Warning ** when starting the regulator, the simulator must be running):

./pid

After starting the regulator, the vehicle should drive in a straight line. This is because the regulator code for steering control has not yet been implemented.
You need to implement a PID controller in C ++. To do this, go to the directory:

cd /homework/homework3/cpp/CarND-PID-Control-Project/src

In this directory, you need to modify 2 files:

* PID.cpp - PID regulator implementation;
* main.cpp - the main file with the main function, which implements the connection to the simulator and the call of the PID regulator.

In PID.cpp, you need to implement 3 functions:

* void PID :: Init (double Kp_, double Ki_, double Kd_) - initialization of the regulator, as well as its internal state;
* void PID :: UpdateError (double cte) - a function that updates the internal state of the regulator (proportional, integral and differential), depending on the error of the vehicle's lateral displacement from the desired trajectory (cross-track error, cte);
* double PID :: TotalError () - calculation of the resulting influence of the regulator (according to the formula of the PID regulator from the lecture), which will be fed to the steering, as the angle of steering wheel rotation.

In main.cpp, you need to modify the main function, in which you need to add the initialization of the PID controller, as well as its use to calculate the steer_value -
control signal for the angle of rotation of the wheels depending on the current error of the lateral displacement from the trajectory (cross-track error, cte).

After making the necessary modifications, rebuild the cmake .. && make project from the /homework/homework3/cpp/CarND-PID-Control-Project/build folder.
Run the simulator and regulator to see the updated car controls.
Select such coefficients of the PID controller (Kp, Ki, Kd) at which the deviation from the trajectory will be minimal.

** Warning! ** For the convenience of programming, the Visual Studio Code development environment is installed in the container.
Launching Visual Studio Code only works from a terminal that allows graphical applications to run.
The Visual Studio Code environment can be launched with the command:

code <source directory> --user-data-dir = / vscode






=========
Python 3.6 and higher
=========

cd /homework/homework3/python

The homework directory contains two files:
* control.py - main file for realizing steering control;
* pid.py - realization of PID regulator.

Realize the PID regulator in order to control the steering of autonomous car. All the instructions are given inside .py files. Note that you should launch control.py script in another terminal (not the one you used to launch simulator).












 code <source directory> --user-data-dir = / vscode
